# Zeus1.0
A Multifunctional Codon Optimization and Analysis Platform

This platform is based on Djiango.

You can deploy on any python-installed server

Because the research is not finished, I can't upload and open source code for the time being, so I can only introduce some functional scripts here.

#Updated in 2019.12.23
I've updated some new analysis features.Three new optimization methods are added.

If you have any questions about the script or need personalized analysisï¼Œplease feel free to contact with me.
